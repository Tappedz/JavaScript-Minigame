# JavaScript-Minigame

Simple JavaScript minigame implemented for a practical assignement in "Ingeniería Web" subject.
Had to choose between these themes:

Tema 1: Jeringa o Aeropuerto o Ventilar
Tema 2: Discoteca o Góndola o Verruga

## First vision of the project (invasionOfWarts0.5)

So I decided to do it about airplanes, airport (1st theme) and warts like alien warts (2nd theme).

### Summary of the first vision (unfinished)

Hordes of alien warts try to attack the airport which you have to protect with fighterjets and
other systems of military defence.

## Final vision of the project (invasionOfWarts)

After starting the development of the first vision of the project I fell into a dead end beacause
of the weak correlation between the themes I chose. I changed the first theme for syringe to somehow
match with warts.

### Summary of the final game

Hordes of alien warts try to attack your spaceship while you collect syringes lost in outer
space to stop the invasion. As you can see it's a game based on the famous atari game asteroids.
